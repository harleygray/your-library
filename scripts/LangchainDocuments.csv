9. Why do we need to put the Voice in the Constitution?05/09/2023, 04:52 10 questions about the V oice to Parliament - answered by the experts
https://theconversation.com/10-questions-about-the-voice-to-parliament-answered-by-the-experts-207014 6/6There are two key parts to this answer. The first is that the Voice has a number of objectives, one of
which is the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as the First
Peoples of the land. First Nations people, through the Uluru Statement from the Heart, indicated they
wished for recognition in the form of the Voice. If we are serious about recognition, we should do it in
a way that accords with the wishes of those to be recognised.
The second part of the answer relates to the operation of the Voice.

the overwhelming majority of expert

We are being asked to abandon equality of citizenship - one of our most important values - in order 
to insert a divisive institution into our system of governance while having only a limited idea about its 
structure and powers, how it would change the business of government and the implications that could 
be read into the new provision by the High Court.  
This referendum should be rejected - primarily because it is wrong in principle but also because the 
proponents of this change have failed to provide the community with enough information to make a fully 
informed decision.  
They have forgotten that the Constitution draws its legitimacy from the entire community - not from 
politicians and insiders.

The constitutional provision requires only that the Voice is an “Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Voice”, and leaves the rules governing its composition to be determined by parliament. It is
appropriate that parliament is responsible for determining the composition of the Voice, because the
identity, experience, culture and views of First Nations across Australia are complex and diverse. This
means it will need to be done in close consultation with local Indigenous communities, and will
require ongoing monitoring, input and evaluation in cooperation with those communities. The
parliament is best placed to undertake that sort of ongoing negotiation.

Australia has come a long way since our Constitution came into effect in 1901.We now rightly celebrate Indigenous Australians and their contributions to our country.At the 1967 referendum, 90% of Australians voted Yes to changing the Constitution, so Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander people would be counted in the population in the same way as everyone else.

This is a correct summary of the constitutional 
function of the Voice, which is described in the 
amendment as making ‘representations’ to the 
Government and the Parliament. These 
representations will inform the work of 
Government and Parliament but are not binding 
on them, and in that respect are about ‘advice’.

The proposed law, being the Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice) 2023, 
would change the Constitution by inserting the following text after Chapter VIII:
Chapter IX—Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander Peoples
129 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice
In recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Peoples 
of Australia:

body, but the department that provides 
advice to the Minister and delivers the

not reflect the intended representative

enacted. There would be a process to consult on and finalise the Voice with the steps outlined below.
Referendum
In late 2023, Australians will have their say in a referendum on whether to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Peoples of Australia in the Constitution through an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice.
Consultation
If the referendum passes, there will be a process with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and the broader public to design the Voice. 
Introduce Voice establishment legislation to Parliament
A bill will then be developed to establish the Voice. This would be introduced to Parliament and may be referred to a parliamentary committee to suggest ways to improve it. Parliament decides if it becomes law.

Voting in a referendum is different 
from an election, and the result is based on how a ‘double majority’ votes – that is:

■ a majority (more than 50%) in a majority of states (at least four of the six states).

1. This idea came directly from Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander people.
Voting Yes means:
• Supporting an aspiration put forward by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over decades.
• Accepting a proposal backed by over 80% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.
The call for a Voice did not come from politicians.
In 2017, after many years of work and countless conversations in every part of the country, nearly 250 Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander leaders and elders endorsed the Uluru Statement from the Heart.
Calling for recognition in the Constitution through a Voice.Asking us to help make practical change in their lives and create better opportunities for their children.

"But that is not the only departure from democratic principle. One of the most startling proposals in 
that report is that the distribution of members of the voice between the states should be done in a manner 
that can only be described as a gerrymander.

has 339,546 Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders which gives that state 34.5 per cent of the nation’s 
indigenous population of 984,002 - the highest proportion of any state.  
Yet the report of the Indigenous Voice Co-Design Process would give NSW a total of just three 
representatives on the proposed 24-member voice. So the state with 34.5 per cent of the nation’s 
indigenous people  would receive 12.5 per cent of the seats on the voice.

But that’s not the real story. This referendum is not about reconciliation. Nor is it about symbolism and being

It would require us to abandon equality of citizenship by giving constitutional standing to a race-based entity 
that could go beyond indigenous affairs and involve itself in all public policy debates.

The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is an independent body created by statute 
to provide for the independent and impartial management of the electoral system 
for voters, including by managing the electoral roll, delivering polling services at 
elections, and conducting education and public awareness campaigns. It is also 
responsible for  conducting referendums under the Referendum (Machinery 
Provisions) Act 1984 (Cth).  
 
Under this legislation, the Electoral Commissioner  is required to distribute the Yes 
and No cases, authorised by the parliamentarians, as part of a pamphlet.  
 
While the pamphlet is called the ”Official” Yes/No pamphlet , it is important to",Expert Analysis of the 'Official Yes and No Cases' published by the Australian Electorial Commission - UNSW.pdf,2023-09-14,https://www.gtcentre.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/documents/Expert%20Analysis%20Yes%20No%20Pamphlet%2028%20August%20FINAL.pdf
"Constitution can be changed by a future 
referendum.

It is correct that the High Court’s 
interpretation of the Constitution is the 
final word on that interpretation, subject 
to a future referendum, or a change in

consequences forever.

This is misleading and an exaggeration. 
The Voice could be removed by a future 
constitutional referendum. Further , the 
constitutional amendment has been 
carefully drafted so that the creation of 
the Voice and its core function are 
constitutionally entrenched, but its 
detailed design will be set by the 
Parliament through the normal, public 
law-making process, and can be 
changed, adapted and improved 
through the normal, public law -making

"Australians should have details before the vote, not after.We don’t know how it will work, we don’t know who will be on it, but we do know it will permanently divide us as

changes. So, what would come next?

Enshrining a Voice in the Constitution for only one group of Australians means permanently dividing our country.
It creates different classes of citizenship through an unknown body that has the full force of the Constitution

"It will include Indigenous Australians from every state and territory, the Torres Strait Islands and representatives 
from the regions and remote communities.
Members of the Voice will be chosen by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in their local area and serve 
for a fixed period.
Why we need it:
There are big challenges facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people:
• A life expectancy 8 years shorter than non-Indigenous Australians.
• Worse rates of disease and infant mortality.
• A suicide rate twice as high.
• Fewer opportunities for education and training.
Clearly, the current approach isn’t working.
To close these gaps, find solutions and plan for the future we need to listen to advice from Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander people about issues affecting their lives and communities.

The Voice is about advice.

• Get better results.",Official Referendum Booklet.pdf,2023-09-14,https://www.aec.gov.au/referendums/files/pamphlet/referendum-booklet.pdf
"First, Indigenous support is demonstrated by the deliberative processes that sits behind the Uluru 
Statement from the Heart. This involved more than 1,200 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
people from across the country (the claim that non-Indigenous people attended the dialogues is false).
From this process, delegates were able to arrive at a national consensus position, prioritising the
reforms of Voice, towards Makarrata (Treaty and Truth).
Second, polling confirms the Voice continues to receive overwhelming Indigenous support. Two polls
from 2023 confirm that 80% and 83% of Indigenous people support the Voice.
Further, Indigenous organisations across the country have indicated their support for the Voice. This
includes land-based representative bodies such as the Northern Territory Land Councils and the
Kimberley Land Council, and peak service organisations such as the Australian Indigenous Doctors 
Association.

"the broader national interest in order to appease the voice or gain its support.  
Constitutionally, governments would still need to maintain the confidence of parliament. But if 
Albanese is right, political reality would give all governments a strong inventive to placate the voice.  
Formally, the voice would merely be providing advice. But in practical terms, it would have real 
influence over the development of public policy affecting the broader community while remaining 
accountable only to its race-based constituency.  
All groups in society, including indigenous communities, have interests that need to be balanced. 
Giving constitutional standing and public funding to any single community group would rig the process 
of balancing conflicting interests and allocating resources, which is the core business of government.

"The government bears the onus of explaining the requirements, implications and restrictions that 
would arise from the proposed constitutional provision. That requires the publication of independent 
legal advice on the proposed provision - preferably from Solicitor-General Stephen Donaghue rather than 
those associated with the “yes” case.  
That has not happened.  
This is quite apart from the failure to provide an outline of the statute that would create the new 
entity if the referendum succeeds. Requiring such information is not unreasonable, nor is it racist.  These 
failures are a departure from normal practice and should not be rewarded.  They show insufficient 
respect for the fact that the Constitution draws its legitimacy not from politicians and insiders but from 
the entire community.

The Uluru Statement from the Heart says a Voice is a first step, before a treaty and truth telling.
By definition, a treaty is an agreement between governments, not between one group of citizens and its 
government.
A member of the Government’s Referendum Working Group has described “truth” as “leverage” to lead to “the 
abolishment of the old colonial institutions”.
“It is a way to further what we need for our people in any negotiations for treaties and for other things like legislation, reform and abolishment of the institutions, the old colonial institutions that harm us.”

No. In fact, the Voice is supported under international human rights law as it recognises Indigenous
peoples’ rights to political representation and is consistent with the UN Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples.

treating people exactly the same. Indeed, this type of formal equality will often result in ongoing

hand, the same power could also arguably be used to pass laws that operate to their detriment. Its
existence and breadth underscores the need for a mechanism – the Voice – to listen to the very people

"the voice plus an additional seat for those islanders who reside on the mainland.  
When those three seats are included in Queensland’s tally, the sunshine state would have six of the 24 
seats on the voice - twice as many as NSW. Yet the ABS population estimates show that Queensland has 
just 273,224 Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, which is 66,322 fewer than in NSW.  
These departures from democratic principle would not be tolerated in any other representative body, 
state or federal, that is part of this country’s system of governance. Yet this plan for the voice would 
deprive the nation’s largest cohort of indigenous citizens - those in NSW - of fair treatment.  
These shortcomings were not mentioned by the prime minister when he rose in the House of 
Representatives on November 30 last year holding a copy of the Calma-Langton report, and said: “There 
are 280 pages of detail about how the voice will operate.”",The Case for Voting No - Rule of Law Education Centre.pdf,2023-09-14,https://www.ruleoflaw.org.au/wp-content/uploads/Voice-Case-for-No-PDF.pdf
"Voice will require more investment than 
its ongoing operation. Further, once 
established, the evidence suggests that 
the Voice will start to result in better

There are many and Aboriginal and

 Such a restriction would risk being struck down as inconsistent with the words of the constitutional 
provision which contain no such restrictions. 
The prime minister unveiled the preliminary wording of this provision in July, 2022, at the Garma

“The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice may make representations to Parliament and the 
executive government on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.” 
So what would this include? Native title to land clearly relates to Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander people - but so does taxation and economic policy. Indigenous people pay taxes and are affected

instance, general election laws would fall within the scope of the V oice because of the disproportionately low
enrolment and participation rates of First Nations people.
Some have argued this remit is too broad, potentially allowing the V oice to give advice on almost any issue.
The opposition has said the V oice could present its views, for example, on the setting of interest rates or the
formulation of climate policy .
Supporters of the government’ s proposal argue  it is both necessary and appropriate for the V oice to be able

• Recognises First Peoples in our Constitution.
• A committee of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.
• Gives people a say on issues affecting them.
• Listening will mean better results – and better value for money.
• Representatives from all states and territories, the Torres Strait Islands and remote communities.
• Will include young people and a balance of men and women.
• Parliament and Government still responsible for laws, programs and funding.

INTRODUCTION 
 
The real issue at this year’s indigenous voice referendum is a question of principle: Will we abandon 
the egalitarian nature of Australian democracy?  
Will we, in other words, join the crackpots of history by introducing into our Constitution the concept 
of racial preference that lies at the core of this referendum? Or will we defend the ideals of liberal 
democracy that emerged in revolutionary America and France?  
We are being asked to give one racial group - and their descendants for all time - constitutionally 
guaranteed additional influence over all areas of public policy. If you tick the right race box you would 
gain political influence exceeding that enjoyed by every other Australian.

"The involvement of the voice would be triggered by the existence of a matter that relates to 
indigenous people. The fact that such a matter might primarily relate to the broader community would be 
irrelevant. If it relates to indigenous people as well, the voice could have a role.

Voice will complement, not detract, from their work. For instance, peak service organisations working
in areas such as health, education and law, offer important Indigenous specific services and advice to
government in service delivery, they are not representative.
And while there may be more Aboriginal parliamentarians than ever – and this should be celebrated –
these individuals do not primarily represent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. They are
party members bound by party policy, or individual MPs, who represent the whole of their

"attention. Instead, it would be far more likely to be influenced by the representations of other bodies
that have greater expertise on the subject.
The second factor is the quality of the Voice’s representations. If it makes measured, well-researched,
evidence-based representations that make practical suggestions, it is likely to be influential.
However, if it were to spread itself too thin by making poorly considered representations about a wide
variety of matters outside its expertise, or make impractical or partisan representations, then it would
be less likely to be influential. So it will be a matter for the Voice itself to secure influence by ensuring
the high quality of its representations.
Could the courts force the government or parliament to implement the
Voice’s representations?

In late 2023, Australians will have their say in a referendum to recognise Aboriginal and  
Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Peoples of Australia through an  
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice enshrined in our Constitution.
What is the Constitution?
The Australian Constitution is the set of rules by which 
Australia is governed.  
The only way to change the Constitution is by holding a 
referendum. It is up to the Australian people to decide if the Constitution should change.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and 
non-Indigenous Australians.

• Making a practical difference for the future.

"10. THERE ARE BETTER WAYS FORWARD
This referendum is not about simply recognising Indigenous Australians in the Constitution.That can be achieved without tying it to a risky, unknown and permanent Voice.Recognition has the widespread support of Australians. However, this Voice proposal is the problem.There are many Australians who oppose a Voice on principle.Others might be willing to consider a less risky Voice option, but the Government has not given you this choice.When previous changes to the Constitution have been proposed, there has been a Constitutional Convention to 
properly consider options and details.
No such process happened here. This process was rushed and heavy-handed.This approach isn’t unifying, or effective. It’s divisive.

This is a very important decision. Unfortunately, the legitimate questions and concerns of many Australians have 
been dismissed.",Official Referendum Booklet.pdf,2023-09-14,https://www.aec.gov.au/referendums/files/pamphlet/referendum-booklet.pdf
"- Members of the Voice would be Aboriginal 
and/or Tor res Strait Islander, according to the 
standard three part test.  
- Members would be chosen from each of the 
states, territories and the Torres Strait Islands.  
- The Voice would have specific remote 
representatives as well as representation for 
the mainland To rres Strait Islander 
population.  
- The Voice will have balanced gender 
representation at the national level.  
 
The Design Principles also include that ‘Members 
would serve on the Voice for a fixed period of  
 14 time, to ensure regular accountability to their 
communities’.  
 
The constitutional amendment refers to the core 
function of the Voice as making representations

peoples. It is accurate to describe this function as 
giving ‘advice ’ in that it will not have any binding 
effect on government and the Parliament. There",Expert Analysis of the 'Official Yes and No Cases' published by the Australian Electorial Commission - UNSW.pdf,2023-09-14,https://www.gtcentre.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/documents/Expert%20Analysis%20Yes%20No%20Pamphlet%2028%20August%20FINAL.pdf
"The Voice will advise on practical steps to improve Indigenous health, education, employment and housing.
Putting the Voice in the Constitution gives it stability and independence, now and into the future.This means the Voice can give frank advice, without getting caught up in short-term politics.We can’t solve all the challenges Indigenous Australians face overnight. We need action now, as well 
as planning for the long term.
That’s why we need a Voice that can’t be abolished with the stroke of a pen.Legal experts have made it clear that the Voice will not have the power to prevent, delay or veto laws or 
decisions. The Voice is about advice.

between a purely legislated model, and a 
constitutional model of the Voice, as is being 
proposed. In the past, Indigenous representative 
advisory bodies have been abolished by 
governments, which has had negative 
consequences for their independence, their 
stability and their ability to make a difference.

The influence of the Voice
The power and influence of the Voice will not be static. It will depend on two factors – relevance and
quality.
The proposed amendment, as currently drafted, gives the Voice a potentially wide remit. It says it may
make representations to both parliament and the executive government “on matters relating to
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples”.
This could include laws and policies that specifically relate to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
peoples, such as those concerning native title or the protection of cultural heritage. It could also
include laws of general application which have a particular impact upon Indigenous Australians.
An example might be a future law that required photo identification for people to be able to vote in",What happens if the government goes against the advice of the Voice to Parliament - The Conversation.pdf,2023-09-14,https://theconversation.com/what-happens-if-the-government-goes-against-the-advice-of-the-voice-to-parliament-200517

In the words of a constitutional law 
professor who supports the Voice:

does is retain the full range of review of

submarines to parking tickets…We will 
have regular judicial interventions.”

"justified because parliament can already make special laws on indigenous matters and this will merely allow 
indigenous people to have a say on those laws.  
But if closing the gap on disadvantage and making better laws on indigenous affairs were the true goal, why has 
the constitutional provision been drafted in a way that would permit this entity to dissipate its efforts across the 
entire range of federal public policy?  
Why did the proponents of this change decline to confine the voice to matters that only affect indigenous people, 
or even primarily affect indigenous people?  
Without such limits, this looks like an attempt to establish a shadow government that would be free to develop 
policies on everything. Those policies would be formally framed as advice but, according to prime minister Anthony 
Albanese, it would be a brave government that ignored its advice.  3",The Case for Voting No - Rule of Law Education Centre.pdf,2023-09-14,https://www.ruleoflaw.org.au/wp-content/uploads/Voice-Case-for-No-PDF.pdf

debate that affects the broader community so long as it also relates to Aborigines and Torres Strait

6. Don’t Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people already have lots of

No. There is currently no representative body to provide, in a nationally coordinated way, the
government and parliament with the views and experience of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander people who will be affected by their decisions.

"made in an unfair manner. If, for example, a law said the decision-maker must take into account
representations of the Voice before making a certain type of decision, failure to do so would mean the
decision was invalid. The court would then send the decision back to the decision-maker to be remade
once the relevant representations had been taken into account.
In these cases, the courts are only concerned with the fairness of the process – that the decision is
made properly, taking into account all relevant considerations – not the content of the decision.
The decision-maker could remake the decision, taking into account the representation, and still not
give effect to the representation. This would be perfectly valid. There is no obligation to give effect to
the representation – only to take it into account, if the law requires the decision-maker to do so.

Voice in their mind, only to find the subsequent constitutional version takes a dif ferent shape.

it can only be abolished by another referendum, rather than by a change of government policy. This

First, the call for the Voice reform is based on the strong assertion in the Uluru Statement from the 
Heart of the continuing and unceded sovereignty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.
Second, there is nothing in the Voice proposal which alters the British Crown’s assertion of
sovereignty at settlement, nor the fact that First Nations people have never consented to the forceful
transfer of sovereignty to the Australian nation as we now know it.

The third is under international law, which requires the agreement or consent of Aboriginal and

Decisions made with the best will in the world from Canberra can always be improved by listening to
the people on the ground who are affected by them. The role of the Voice would therefore be
important in improving the quality and effectiveness of laws and government policies. But it could not
determine what those laws and policies will be.

Our Constitution belongs to all Australians. Our Parliament is there to represent all Australians. It now includes a

interpret the Constitution as requiring this in all cases. This seems most unlikely, given neither the
words nor the intent of the provision support such an interpretation.
A former chief justice of Australia, Robert French, has said there is “little or no scope for any court to
find constitutional legal obligations in the facilitative and empowering provisions of the amendment”.
In other words, all the amendment does is allow the Voice to make representations - it does not
impose legal or constitutional obligations on how the government and parliament respond to them.
So, if the government and parliament disagree with the Voice, they are not required to give effect to its
representations.",What happens if the government goes against the advice of the Voice to Parliament - The Conversation.pdf,2023-09-14,https://theconversation.com/what-happens-if-the-government-goes-against-the-advice-of-the-voice-to-parliament-200517

SCOPE: DO WE WANT A RACE-BASED INSTITUTION TO PROPOSE ITS OWN POLICIES

One of the main flaws in the referendum proposal is that it would give the new institution unlimited 
jurisdiction. This was made clear on January 23 by Noel Pearson, one of the key proponents of the voice. 
He told Patricia Karvelas on ABC radio: “There is hardly any subject matter that indigenous people 
would not be affected by and would not want to provide their advice to parliament.” 
 
Indigenous constitutional lawyer Megan Davis, who helped develop the voice proposal, shares this 
view. On December 21 last year she was asked on ABC television what issues indigenous Australians 
wanted to talk about to parliament through the voice.

information to voters in referendums, and it was hoped that the arguments would be 
put impartially and without misleading or incorrect claims. However, the pamphlet
