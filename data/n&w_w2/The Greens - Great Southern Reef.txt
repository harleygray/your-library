    "text": "For decades, climate change has ravaged giant and golden kelp forests in the Great Southern Reef, as well as many sea grasses, Crayweed and other marine habitats. While rapid and signiﬁcant climate mitigation will be essential to the survival of these habitats, there is much more we can do to try and protect what remains and restore what has been lost. All these seaweeds generate vibratant aquatic habitats essential to marine life and commercial ﬁsheries, and have been identiﬁed as an important source of carbon sequestration. Protecting the Great Southern Reef requires investment in researching, protecting and restoring kelp forests and other marine habitats.",

The Greens will tax billionaires with a new ‘billionaires tax’, require big corporations making excessive proﬁts to pay a ‘corporate super-proﬁts tax’ and axe billions of dollars in handouts to the coal, oil and gas giants that are driving the climate crisis. When big corporations and billionaires pay their fair share, we can tackle the climate crisis and support farmers.",

    "text": "Giant kelp are the world’s largest species of marine algae. Kelp forests and seaweeds of all kinds are enormously important for sea life and have been an important source of sustenance and seafood for First Nations peoples for tens of thousands of years, and are critical to the commercial and recreational ﬁshing sectors today. They can act as a cushion against storm surges, cleanse water, and absorb carbon dioxide. Kelp forests generate vibrant aquatic ecologies, creating a healthy oceanic area for marine life.",

    "text": "Despite being Australia’s ﬁrst listed “threatened ecological community'' in 2012 under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, no required giant kelp recovery plan has been enacted. Successive Labor and Liberal governments have failed to suﬃciently act. There has been no signiﬁcant investment in research funding for restoration or building other resilience measures for giant kelp ecological communities. It is estimated that the Great Southern Reef has received just $4 million in research funding over 25 years. The Greens will begin by allocating $20 million towards delivering a full recovery plan for giant kelp as required under EPBC law, including: Research targeted towards mitigating key risks to kelp communities and how best to adapt to a future of warmer oceans; Developing a cost-effective and robust strategy to understand why the last 5% of giant kelp forests have survived genetically developing warmer water tolerant species; Setting appropriate governance arrangements for restoration; Fully mapping remaining habitat and understanding how this data can be best applied to restoring these critical ecosystems.",

This team will work collaboratively with ﬁsheries and other stakeholders (state and local governments, First Nations and other communities etc) to research and implement a holistic plan to tackle one of the key risks to kelp forests and marine habitat survival on the Great Southern Reef - the slow the spread of invasive Centrostephanus rodgersii sea urchins in NSW, Victoria and Tasmania.",

This unit would also invest in: Researching best governance structures for the eradication of urchins and restoring habitat; Comprehensive mapping of urchin barrens; Better understanding mitigation measures like predation; Changes to ﬁsheries practises and use of marine protected areas; How best to facilitate the economic removal of urchins for healthy reef restoration; Exploring all economic opportunities for urchin capture",

    "text": "Described as the backbone of the Great Southern Reef, golden kelp also plays a vital role in the health of the reef system. It is a foundation species, providing habitat, food and shelter for hundreds of species. Like giant kelp, golden kelp take carbon out of the ocean, but are very susceptible to the impacts of warming oceans and climate change. The Greens will see that golden kelp is also proposed for EPBC listing as a Threatened Ecological Community under Federal law, and a fully funded recovery plan is implemented.",

It is estimated to be worth more than $10 billion annually to the economy through ﬁshing and tourism dollars alone and its cultural signiﬁcance to First Nations communities is invaluable. Sixteen million Australians including thousands of First Nations communities live within 50km of the Great Southern Reef yet few politicians and decision makers or the media recognise its discrete identity and importance.",

    "text": "A Senate inquiry, initiated by the Greens in this parliament, heard an abundance of evidence detailing the risks to our oceans and ﬁsheries from ongoing seismic testing used for oil and gas exploration. The Greens believe the regulatory framework governing these risks is completely inadequate, structured to suit oil and gas proponents and does not suﬃciently protect the environment. The Greens will legislate or regulate to make sure existing voluntary ‘Good Standing Agreements” for industry-funded seismic testing research becomes compulsory or mandatory for all seismic activity. This research funding would be administered by an independent authority and would be conducted by independent research institutions such as the Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies. Any future seismic testing surveys will need to provide a comprehensive evidence-based approach to collecting before and after baseline data showing all impacts of testing in Great Southern Reef areas. This would help protect coastal communities, help commercial ﬁshing operators seek compensation and build the body of scientiﬁc evidence necessary to tackle the uncertainty used to justify this harmful practice in our oceans.",
